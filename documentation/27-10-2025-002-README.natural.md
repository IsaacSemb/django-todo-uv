I have done this for a 101 dive into the uv depenedecy manage as a replacement for pip, just seeing how it works

creating a new project with uv

```bash
uv init <projectname>
```

by the way unlike pip, it doesnt come with python
just curl it and get it

curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

`curl`  — the command-line HTTP client that downloads the remote bytes.
`-L`    — follow redirects (if the URL responds with a redirect, follow it).
`-s`    — “silent” mode: hides progress meter and most messages (makes output quiet).
`-S`    — when combined with -s, show errors (so you still see curl error text).
`-f`    — fail silently on HTTP errors (4xx/5xx); curl will exit non-zero and produce no body on error.
`https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh` — the resource being requested (the installer script).
`|`     — pipe: send the downloaded bytes into the next command’s stdin.
`sh`    — the POSIX shell; it reads the script from stdin and executes it.

`curl -LsSf URL | sh `

fetch the script quietly (following redirects), but fail on HTTP error, then immediately execute the downloaded script with sh.

to start a project with uv

run
uv init

what this will do:
it will create the starting files of the uv project
as of right now

$ tree -a -I .git
.
|-- .gitignore
|-- .python-version
|-- README.md
|-- main.py
`-- pyproject.toml

the lack of a venv file scared me but guess what
when you install your first dependecy, uv does everythign for you lolllll (how convenient)

i stumbled upon it when i was looking for the venv and the instruction i was given was
`uv run pip list`

and i kid you not, uv created the venv added pip and then showed it to me lol (so cool)
btw when you do anything that create the venv ( for my case ,, demandingto see pip or adding packages),
uv create a uv.lock file

the same thing like npm createing a package lock
btw: package json === pyproject.toml

if you want to see your list like pip list
you run

```bash
uv tree
```

to run python using the uv context, you always prefix with uv
so to run the main file
`uv run python main.py`

you can create a shortcut for that
remember in npm we have scripts part this is the same
in the toml file
add

```toml
[project.scripts]
joke = "main:get_joke"
```

unlike in npm where there is some sort of auto sync, you need to inform uv here
then you can run the command

```bash
uv sync
```
